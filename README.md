# COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on global and country-level **COVID-19 data**. Through various visualizations and statistical techniques, this project aims to:
- Analyze COVID-19 trends globally and locally (by country).
- Understand key features of the data such as infection rates, mortality rates, and vaccination progress.
- Identify patterns, outliers, and correlations in the dataset.
- Create actionable insights using various plots and reports.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to provide clear insights into the **spread and impact of COVID-19** worldwide. Key questions addressed include:
- What are the most affected regions by COVID-19?
- How have case numbers and deaths evolved over time?
- What are the trends in COVID-19 vaccination?

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and documenting the analysis.
- **Dash/Plotly**: For creating interactive dashboards (optional).
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.
- **GitHub**: For repository hosting and sharing.

## Dataset
This project utilizes COVID-19 datasets from various reliable sources like:
- [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
- [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data)
- [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

### **Dataset Sources**
- **COVID-19 confirmed cases**: Case data reported globally and at the country level.
- **Deaths and recoveries**: Information on the number of deaths and recoveries.
- **Vaccination data**: Global and country-wise vaccination statistics.

## Folder Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

COVID19_EDA_Project/ ├── data/
│ ├── raw/ # Raw data files (unprocessed, original datasets) │ └── processed/ # Cleaned data files (after pre-processing and transformation) ├── notebooks/
│ ├── data_cleaning.ipynb # Notebook for cleaning raw data │ ├── exploratory_analysis.ipynb # Notebook for exploratory analysis and insights │ └── visualizations.ipynb # Notebook for generating visualizations like plots and graphs ├── dashboard/ # (Optional) Files for building interactive visualizations using Dash ├── reports/ │ └── visuals/ # Saved visualizations for reports and presentations (e.g., PNG, PDF) ├── .gitignore # Git ignore file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from version control ├── LICENSE # License file to define terms for project usage and distribution ├── README.md # Project documentation (this file) └── requirements.txt # List of required Python dependencies for the project

### **Folder Details**
- **`data/raw/`**: Raw datasets that are downloaded and need processing.
- **`data/processed/`**: Cleaned and transformed data that will be used for analysis.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks that contain the code for the EDA process, visualizations, and conclusions.
- **`dashboard/`**: (Optional) Files for building interactive visualizations using Dash.
- **`reports/visuals/`**: Saved visualizations (e.g., PNG, PDF files) for reports and presentations.
