# COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on global and country-level **COVID-19 data**. Through various visualizations and statistical techniques, this project aims to:
- Analyze COVID-19 trends globally and locally (by country).
- Understand key features of the data such as infection rates, mortality rates, and vaccination progress.
- Identify patterns, outliers, and correlations in the dataset.
- Create actionable insights using various plots and reports.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to provide clear insights into the **spread and impact of COVID-19** worldwide. Key questions addressed include:
- What are the most affected regions by COVID-19?
- How have case numbers and deaths evolved over time?
- What are the trends in COVID-19 vaccination?

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and documenting the analysis.
- **Dash/Plotly**: For creating interactive dashboards (optional).
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.
- **GitHub**: For repository hosting and sharing.

## Dataset
This project utilizes COVID-19 datasets from various reliable sources like:
- [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
- [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data)
- [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

### **Dataset Sources**
- **COVID-19 confirmed cases**: Case data reported globally and at the country level.
- **Deaths and recoveries**: Information on the number of deaths and recoveries.
- **Vaccination data**: Global and country-wise vaccination statistics.

### Folder Details:
- **`data/raw/`**: Contains the raw datasets that are directly sourced and need processing.
- **`data/processed/`**: Contains cleaned and pre-processed data, ready for analysis.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for carrying out the data analysis, cleaning, and visualizations.
- **`dashboard/`**: Contains Dash application files (if you're creating a web-based dashboard for the project).
- **`reports/visuals/`**: This folder stores the saved visualizations (graphs, plots, charts) for reports.
- **`.gitignore`**: Ensures that unnecessary or temporary files are not tracked by Git (such as compiled Python files, logs, or system files).
- **`LICENSE`**: A file that outlines the licensing terms for your project.
- **`README.md`**: The file you are currently reading, which contains project information and guidelines.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python libraries that are required to run the project (you can generate this by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
