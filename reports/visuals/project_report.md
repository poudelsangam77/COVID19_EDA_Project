# COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project Report

##  Project Overview
This project explores and analyzes global and country-level COVID-19 data through comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. By examining trends, patterns, and statistics, the project aims to provide actionable insights into the pandemic's spread, mortality, and vaccination progress.

---

##  Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To analyze the global trends of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- To study country-level impacts and compare regional variations.
- To evaluate the progress and effectiveness of vaccination programs.
- To generate insights that can assist in understanding the pandemic's overall impact.

---

##  Data Sources
This project uses publicly available datasets from reliable sources:
- **COVID-19 Case Data**: Johns Hopkins University [CSSE COVID-19 Repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
- **Vaccination Data**: Our World in Data [COVID-19 Vaccination Dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data)

##  Cleaning Process
###  Raw Data Issues
- Missing values in various columns.
- Inconsistent date formats.
- Presence of unnecessary columns such as `Province/State`.

###  Steps Performed
- **Handled missing values**: Used appropriate techniques like filling, dropping, or interpolation based on the data type.
- **Standardized date formats**: Converted dates to a uniform format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- **Aggregated data**: Combined regional data to create country-level summaries.
- **Split datasets**: Separated data into confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination.

##  EDA and Visualizations
The following insights were drawn using data visualization techniques.

###  Global Analysis
- **Confirmed Cases Over Time**: Observed exponential growth globally with peaks during major pandemic waves.
- **Mortality Rates**: Fluctuated by region, with some areas significantly higher.
- **Vaccination Trends**: Developed countries showed rapid increases compared to developing nations.

###  Country-Level Analysis
- **Top 10 Affected Countries**: USA, India, and Brazil consistently led in confirmed cases and deaths.
- **Case Fatality Rate (CFR)**: Regions like Italy and the UK showed a higher CFR during initial waves.

###  Vaccination Insights
- **Top Vaccinated Countries**: Countries like Israel, UAE, and the USA showed high vaccination rates early.
- **Effectiveness**: Countries with higher vaccination rates showed a decline in mortality rates.

---

##  Key Findings
- **Global Trends**: COVID-19 cases and deaths followed a cyclical pattern, correlating with waves of infection.
- **Regional Variations**: Developed countries had better healthcare responses but also experienced higher initial cases due to robust testing.
- **Vaccination Impact**: Strong evidence supports that vaccination campaigns reduced mortality rates in most regions.
- **Case Fatality Rate**: Globally, the CFR ranged between 1%â€“3%, with significant variance across regions.

---

##  Limitations
- The data might not fully represent real-time figures due to reporting delays.
- Some regions had incomplete or inconsistent reporting.
- Vaccination data does not include booster doses for all countries.

---
## Dashboard and Interactivity
To extend the project, an interactive dashboard is under development. It will:
- Provide dynamic visualizations for exploring COVID-19 data.
- Enable users to filter and compare country-level statistics interactively.
- Present vaccination trends and their impact on case reduction.

---
## Recommendations
- Develop region-specific strategies for pandemic response based on data insights.
- Strengthen vaccination programs in developing countries.
- Continue monitoring trends to prepare for future pandemics.

---

## Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of data-driven approaches in understanding and responding to global crises like COVID-19. The insights gained through this analysis can guide decision-making and enhance preparedness for similar challenges.
